# Concept:

Flatiron Students Connect is a program designed as place that students can share notes and resources while going through the Flatiron course. While Slack is a useful tool we would often lose resources from the begining of the program 

## As a Student I want to:
  * Take notes
  * Filter my notes by topic
  * Search my notes and public notes for relivant key words 
  * Share my notes with other students
  * Keep a list of Resources that I use regularly 
  * Share those resources with other students
  * See and use resources that other students have found useful
